        <p>When the pandemic started, I found myself stuck at home, working remotely. As a programmer and gamer, a lot of my non-work hours were spent at my desk as well. I figured that it might be nice to spruce my desk up a little bit. I had a beaten old Logitech gaming keyboard that didn't always feel great to type on, and I thought that upping my keyboard game would both spruce my desk up and help my typing. As a bonus, it also gave me something to do with my hands - and I got to learn some soldering too, which is pretty neat!</p>
